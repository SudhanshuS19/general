First party vs third party cookie
First-party cookies are directly created by the website you are using. These are generally safer, as long as you are browsing reputable websites 
Third part:
They are generated by websites that are different from the pages that the users are currently surfing, usually because they're linked to ads on that page. Third-party cookies let advertisers or analytics companies track an individual's browsing history across the web on any sites that contain their ads
