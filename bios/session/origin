Origin is composed of the scheme, port, and host. When combined, they form the origin.

two types of origin: opaque and tuple

tuple origin includes:
    scheme (an ASCII string).
    host (a host).
    port (null or a 16-bit unsigned integer).
    domain (null or a domain). Null unless stated otherwise.

    Two origins, A and B, are said to be same site if both of the following statements are true:

        A and B are schemelessly same site
        A and B are either both opaque origins, or both tuple origins with the same scheme
