AJAX is a developer's dream, because you can:

    Update a web page without reloading the page
    Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
    Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded
    Send data to a server - in the background



The keystone of AJAX is the XMLHttpRequest object.

To send a request to a server, we use the open() and send() methods of the XMLHttpRequest object:
xhttp.open("GET", "ajax_info.txt", true);
xhttp.send();
