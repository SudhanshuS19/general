select * from students order by 2	:	It will output all the rows and sort then by the second column which is f_name
select * from students order by 3	:	It will output all the rows and sort then by the third column which is l_name
select * from students order by 4	:	It will output all the rows and sort then by the forth column which is roll_no
select * from students order by 5	:	It will create an error "Unknown column '5' in 'order clause'"
