CSRF is abt executing actions
diff. btw normal request and CSRF is different origin.
defence against CSRF:
    check referrer and origin(not very affective.)

We add a hidden field called csrf_token inside the form. The value of this field is randomly generated by the server and should be unique for each form submission. The token is stored in the server's session data.

Ways to prevent CSRF:

1. csrf token(stored on server side and client side both..and during the request it checks if both are equal)
2. Submit double cookie (isme dono csrf token client side hi store hote haii but ek set cookie m store hota hai and ek form header m store hota)
